  Kube is a fully managed Kubernetes solution designed to provide advanced capabilities around cluster management and facilitate its integration with Apple-specific technologies. It is an internal distribution of Apple’s opinionated selection of Kubernetes components, extensions, and configuration that is deployed as multiple clusters in multiple regions.

       Kube offers multi-tenant clusters as namespace-as-a-service instead of the more common cluster-as-a-service offered by public cloud providers, provides an additional layer of configurations, security policies, and enforcements that are specific to Apple's needs and constraints, and serves operators and service owners as its end users, instead of cluster administrators.

       Kubernetes, by design, maximizes choice availability with respect to how you use it for cloud orchestration. Any Kubernetes implementation involves making choices in ways that influence other choices. Some of the crucial decisions involve understanding how to gracefully handle security requirements and enable access for the right people to the resources that they need as seamlessly as possible, while minimizing risk.

       As a result, Kubernetes implementations might end up looking very different from each other, and the way you use Kubernetes in one organization could be quite different from how you use it in another organization. Choices that you can make versus the choices that are made for you will vary.
