 Kube is a fully managed Kubernetes solution designed to provide advanced capabilities around cluster management and facilitate its integration with Apple-specific technologies. It is an internal distribution of Apple’s opinionated selection of Kubernetes components, extensions, and configuration that is deployed as multiple clusters in multiple regions.

Kube offers multi-tenant clusters as namespace-as-a-service instead of the more common cluster-as-a-service offered by public cloud providers, provides an additional layer of configurations, security policies, and enforcements that are specific to Apple's needs and constraints, and serves operators and service owners as its end users, instead of cluster administrators.

        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

       Kubernetes, by design, maximizes choice availability with respect to how you use it for cloud orchestration. Any Kubernetes implementation involves making choices in ways that influence other choices. Some of the crucial decisions involve understanding how to gracefully handle security requirements and enable access for the right people to the resources that they need as seamlessly as possible, while minimizing risk.

       As a result, Kubernetes implementations might end up looking very different from each other, and the way you use Kubernetes in one organization could be quite different from how you use it in another organization. Choices that you can make versus the choices that are made for you will vary.

      Kube currently offers two priority classes: P1 and P3. P2 and P4, though deprecated, continue to be supported in preexisting clusters. Resource quota is provisioned for each priority class at the namespace level by the SAFE team. Work with your group to understand which priority classes to specify for your use cases.

  description: >
    Users currently are not allowed to deploy privileged containers. Running a privileged container gives access to all host capabilities, and it also lifts all the limitations enforced by the device cgroup controller. This means the container can then do almost everything that the host can do. We focus instead on allowing only the minimum set of capabilities a container needs, and therefore have a limited set of capabilities we’re focused on enabling.

   With Kubernetes at its core, Kube is typically one minor release behind the latest version of Kubernetes, although it can be more. By staying current, we offer the latest capabilities, documentation and support, and the ability to drive change and enhancements critical to Apple.
